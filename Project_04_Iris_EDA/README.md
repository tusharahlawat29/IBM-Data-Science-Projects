# Project 04: Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project explores the classic Iris dataset to understand the distribution and relationships among the features of different Iris species.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample has 4 features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

## Objective
- Load and understand the dataset
- Visualize distributions of features
- Analyze relationships between features
- Summarize findings for further modeling

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
