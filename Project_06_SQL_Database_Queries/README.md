# Project 06: SQL Database Queries with SQLite

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to work with SQLite databases using Python. We create tables, insert sample data, write various SQL queries including SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, and GROUP BY, and load results into Pandas DataFrames for analysis.

## Dataset
Simulated customer orders database with two tables: customers and orders.

## Objectives
- Connect to SQLite database via Python.
- Perform SQL queries to extract and manipulate data.
- Join tables and perform aggregations.
- Understand integration of SQL with Python for data science.

## Tools Used
- Python
- SQLite (sqlite3 module)
- Pandas

## Key Concepts
- Database connections
- SQL SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY
- Data retrieval and aggregation
- Loading query results into Pandas

## Conclusion
This project builds foundational skills in SQL querying and Python database interaction, essential for handling real-world data stored in databases.
