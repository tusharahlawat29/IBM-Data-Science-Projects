# Project 10: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📘 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on mall customer data.

## 📂 Dataset
We used the **Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**, which contains the following features:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🎯 Objective
Segment customers into distinct groups based on their spending behavior and income using unsupervised machine learning.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Visualizations of Income and Spending Score
- Feature Selection
- Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters
- K-Means Clustering
- Visualizing Clusters and Centroids

## ✅ Outcome
We successfully segmented the customers into 5 distinct clusters based on their income and spending behavior, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies.
