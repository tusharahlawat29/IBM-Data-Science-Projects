# Project 09: Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple classification model using logistic regression to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical measurements.

## 📂 Dataset
We used the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains:
- 8 medical input features (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Age)
- 1 binary output (`Outcome`: 0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore a real-world medical dataset
- Build a logistic regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize the confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Key Concepts
- Logistic Regression
- Binary Classification
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall)
- Data Visualization

## ✅ Conclusion
This project provided practical exposure to building and evaluating a logistic regression model. With a high-level understanding of medical data and predictive modeling, we can assess health risks and support early diagnosis.
