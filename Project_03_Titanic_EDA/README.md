# Titanic EDA Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.

## Goals:
- Visualize survival rate
- Analyze relationships between Age, Sex, Class, and Survival
- Generate insights for future model building

## Tools:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Summary:
We found that females had a higher survival rate, passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive, and age also played a role.
