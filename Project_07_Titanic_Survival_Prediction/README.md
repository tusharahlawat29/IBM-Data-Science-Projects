## **Project 07: Titanic Survival Prediction**

### **Overview**

This project aims to build a binary classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. Using the Logistic Regression algorithm, we analyze key features such as passenger class, age, fare, and sex to determine survival probability.

---

### **Dataset**

We used the Titanic dataset available directly via the `Seaborn` library, which includes details such as age, gender, fare, class, and survival status of passengers.

### **Objectives**

* Load and clean Titanic dataset using Pandas
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Encode categorical features for model compatibility
* Build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model
* Visualize model performance (Confusion Matrix)

---

### **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

### **Key Concepts**

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Feature encoding and selection
* Model training with Logistic Regression
* Model evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
* Data visualization

---

### **Conclusion**

This project introduced Logistic Regression for binary classification. While the model achieved a baseline accuracy of around **78%**, improvements can be made through advanced feature engineering and use of more powerful algorithms. It demonstrates the integration of machine learning into the data science workflow using Python.
