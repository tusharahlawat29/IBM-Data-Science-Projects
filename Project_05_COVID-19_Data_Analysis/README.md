# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we analyze confirmed cases, deaths, and death rates over time and across countries.

## 📁 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is from:
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/main/data/countries-aggregated.csv

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore the COVID-19 dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Visualize global trends in confirmed and death cases
- Identify the top 15 affected countries
- Calculate and visualize death rates

---

## 📊 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. Import libraries and load dataset
2. Check nulls and convert date column
3. Group and aggregate global daily trends
4. Plot time-series line charts
5. Identify top 15 countries with highest confirmed cases
6. Bar charts for confirmed cases and death rates
7. Calculate death rate (%) by country

## ✅ Conclusion

This EDA gives insights into how the pandemic evolved globally and identifies which countries were most affected at the time of the latest dataset. The trends help us understand both the scale and pace of the COVID-19 outbreak.
