# Project 08: House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project explores the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices based on various attributes using a Linear Regression model.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains information on housing in Boston suburbs, including features such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more.

## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Visualize feature correlations with house prices
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance with MSE and R²
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of approximately [fill with your R² score], indicating how well the model explains the variance in house prices.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a regression model for real-world numeric prediction tasks.
